        <p class="content">Inequality in Latin America is much higher than in
        Europe and the US. The income distribution in the region is also much
        more skewed, displaying a thicker left tail. And, like those comparison
        economies, it also exhibits a long right tail. We illustrate the link
        between this bipolar character of inequality in the region and the
        similarly bipolar character of the distribution of productive units,
        where income is generated. The firm size distribution in Latin America
        is dominated by a plethora of tiny businesses, which absorb several
        times more employment than in the US and Europe and exhibit a much lower
        relative productivity, while its upper tail exhibits higher market
        concentration. 34% of the distance in the 50/10 personal income gap
        between Latin America and the US is explained by a higher concentration
        of workers in the categories with poorer relative income and
        productivity: self-employment and employment in micro establishments. In
        the right tail of the income distribution, the larger 90/50 personal
        income gap in the region compared to the US is fully explained by the
        larger relative income of business owners of large firms with high
        relative markups. We show that market concentration in the region is
        large and tied to small labor shares. It is also closely tied to the
        extreme dispersion of productivity and the prevalence of low
        productivity businesses. The central message is that high inequality in
        the region is deeply rooted in the productivity problem.</p>

        <p class="content">This paper studies gender biases in the student
        evaluations of teaching at a university in Colombia. I use a linear
        regression with student fixed effects that account for grades and
        professor skills, measured with a value-added model, to determine that,
        on average, full-time female professors receive evaluations lower by
        0.07 standard deviations than male professors. Meanwhile, there are no
        gender differences among adjunct professors or teacher assistants.
        However, there is significant heterogeneity. In courses with 35 to 55
        year-old professors, with more than 50 students, or with a smaller share
        of female students, female professors are discriminated against the
        most. In such cases, biases have a magnitude of about 0.1-0.2 standard
        deviations and represent 40\% of all evaluations. Additionally, women
        are mostly described with words related to personal characteristics
        ("kind" or "comprehensive"), and men are associated with course-related
        topics or positive adjectives ("topic", "exam", "talented"). Based on
        the results found, I propose several possible measures to reduce student
        bias and allow analysis on the evaluations to consider the gender
        differences. </p>
