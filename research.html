        <p class="content"> I study the impact of rebel governance on economic development in rural Colombia. 
                            In 1998 the Colombian government created a 42,000 square km demilitarized zone (DMZ) to negotiate with FARC, Colombia's largest and oldest rebel group. 
                            Using a spatial regression discontinuity design, I exploit the DMZ's border defined by municipalities' pre-existing administrative boundaries to examine 
                            the causal effects of rebel-based social order on education, living conditions, and agricultural production. I show that rebel governance increased the 
                            years of education by 0.1 standard deviations, access to aqueduct systems by 11 percentage points, and agricultural yield by 16 percent. These findings 
                            appear driven by public goods provision and less exposure to violence during rebels' rule.  </p>

        <p class="content"> This paper quantifies the relationship between legal cigarette sales, smuggling and tobacco taxes in Colombia. Using a two-part econometric approach, the paper 
                            concludes that (i) taxes correlate negatively to legal sales and positively with illegal sales, and (ii) increments in the smuggling flows into the country 
                            relate negatively to legal sale </p>

        <p class="papertitle"><b style="font-size: 13pt;"> The Effects of Teacher Job Burnout on Child Development </b> (With <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/raquelbernal" target="_blank" class="externalsites">Raquel Bernal</a> and Maria de la Paz Ferro)</p>
        <p class="content"> In this paper, we assess the impacts of teachers’ job burnout on children’s early development. To this aim, we use a sample of one thousand children 18-36 months of age at baseline, attending public 
                            center-based childcare in eight large cities in Colombia between 2013 and 2014. We measure job burnout using the MBI-ES instrument for 267 teachers. We assess children’s receptive language, school 
                            readiness, self-regulation, and socio-emotional development. The identification strategy exploits the longitudinal nature of the dataset for both teachers and children to estimate an added-value 
                            specification that controls for baseline developmental outcomes and uses lagged teacher burnout to address potential endogeneity biases. The results indicate that teacher job burnout has sizeable 
                            negative effects on children’s cognitive development, self-regulation and socio-emotional development. These effects seem to be driven by changes in the warmth and sensibility of teacher-child 
                            interactions rather than by the type and frequency of pedagogical activities in the classroom.   </p>
